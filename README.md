# Roominate

Roominate is a collaborative group game that provides the user with an intriguing hypothetical situation which is debated by the group until a majority consesus it reached.  Users are able to record the group's decision through the app.  Groups are able to add their own hypotheticals, and delete questions that are deemed inappropriate.
